In these projects we deal with the classification problem of the CIFAR10 database

Project 0: Use KNearestNeighbotrs and NearestCentroids algorithms
Project 1: Creates an MLP from scratch 
Project 2: Use the SVM method and GridSearch for the hyperparameters
Project 3: Classification through dimension reduction using RBFNN
