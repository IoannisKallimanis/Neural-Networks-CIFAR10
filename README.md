In these projects we deal with the classification problem of the CIFAR10 database for a uni Project.  
  
**Project 0**: Use KNearestNeighbotrs and NearestCentroids algorithms.  
**Project 1**: Creates an MLP from scratch.  
**Project 2**: Use the SVM method and GridSearch for the hyperparameters.  
**Project 3**: Classification through dimension reduction using RBFNN.  
**CNN**: The last Project using CNN model (this arichitecture has the best result).
