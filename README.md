In these projects we deal with the classification problem of the CIFAR10 database \n
\n
Project 0: Use KNearestNeighbotrs and NearestCentroids algorithms \n
Project 1: Creates an MLP from scratch \n
Project 2: Use the SVM method and GridSearch for the hyperparameters \n
Project 3: Classification through dimension reduction using RBFNN \n
